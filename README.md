Abstract
--------
[**Wheat spindle streak mosaic virus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_spindle_streak_mosaic_virus) (WSSMV) is a major disease of durum wheat in Europe and North America. Breeding is currently the only way to control the virus since no treatment is available.  
This paper studies the **genetic determinism** of WSSMV resistance using two connected durum wheat populations obtained by crossing two elite varieties with a WSSMV resistant emmer cultivar. In 2012 and 2015, 354 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) were phenotyped using visual notations, ELISA and qPCR and genotyped using locus targeted capture.  
This allowed us to build a consensus genetic map of 8568 markers and identify three chromosomal regions involved in WSSMV resistance. The two major regions (located on chromosomes 7A and 7B) jointly explain, on the basis of epistatic interactions, up to 43% of the phenotypic variation.  
Flanking sequences of our genetic markers are provided to facilitate future marker-assisted selection of WSSMV resistant cultivars.
